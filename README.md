# WebAssembly course

In this course you will get an introduction to WebAssembly and 3D visualization using Three.js.

WebAssembly is a binary compilation format which lets you run languages like C, C++ and Rust in the browser.
This means exising code can be used in web application and possibilies for increased performance by using lower-level languages than JavaScript.
Three.js is a highly successful library which is used to create 3D applications which run in the browser.

At Spacemaker we use Three.js in large parts of our applications to let our users interact buildings on
building sites, and to visualize analysis of the buildings. WebAssembly is an emerging technology
which we have done some experiments with and are considering to include in our product.

In the first part of the course we will give you an introduction to WebAssembly and Three.js, and in the
the second part you will finish a project which combines both these technologies to find an optimal
utilization of a building site. (no prior knowledge about WebAssembly, Three.js or optimization is required.)

## Usage

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Build the code with `npm run build`

Start a web server `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8083`
